data-scrubbing
==============

 This project contains one R script, `run_analysis.R`, that:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
  measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
  for each activity and each subject. 

This script will detect whether the file "activity.zip" is present in the 
current working directory.  If it isn't,
it will retrieve the data file.

If the /data subdirectory is present in the working directory, the script 
will assume the raw file has been unpacked.
Otherwise it will unpack the "activity.zip" file into /data.
